👨🏼‍🌾I am currently a doctoral student at Zhejiang University, majoring in Agricultural Electrification 
and Automation, advised by Prof. Fei Liu. 🧠My study is focused on UAV image Processing amd Analyzing using Deep-Learning based methods. 

🔭I have been working on UAV image super-resolution with varianve-enhanced diffusion-model during 2023, and trying to bridge UAV🛸 and satellite🛰️ data to achieve large-area remote sensing image refinement.
⚡In 2022, I designed a UAV image-sequence direct geo-location and trait-extraction system for real-time crop field sensing.
🌈In the next 2 years, I plan to achieve automatic few-shots learning for anomaly (pest & disease stress) region detection at crop field using UAV hyper/multi-spectral imaging, and set out to study crop points cloud☁️ segmentation & 3D traits measurment📏 using UAV LiDAR.
