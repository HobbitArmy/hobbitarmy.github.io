I am currently a doctoral student at Zhejiang University, majoring in Agricultural Electrification 
and Automation👨🏼‍🌾, advised by Prof. Fei Liu. My study is focused on field crop traits extracting 
and mapping using UAV imagery and deep-learning methods🤖. 

I have been working on rice field segmentation and phenology detection using direct geo-located UAV imagery during 2022.
Recently I am working on super resolution techniques to bridge UAV🛸 and satellite🛰️ data. 
In the next 3 years, I plan to achieve automatic crop points cloud☁️ segmentation & 3D traits measurment📏 using UAV LiDAR, 
and detect pest & disease stress of crops using UAV hyper/multi-spectral🌈 imaging.
