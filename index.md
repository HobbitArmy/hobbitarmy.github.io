👨🏼‍🌾I am a Ph.D student in Zhejiang University, and currently visiting University of Toronto for 1 year. 
🎄My study is focused on UAV, image processing, deep-learning techniques especially in Agriculture & Ecology scenes.

🛸I have been working on UAV image super-resolution with varianve-enhanced diffusion-model during 2023, which is promised to bridge UAV and satellite🛰️ data to achieve large-area remote sensing image refinement.
🐣In 2022, I designed a UAV image-sequence direct geo-location and trait-extraction system for real-time crop field sensing.
🔑 Now I am work on 1.Paddy field weed sensing & grading; 2.Forest tree crown instance segmentation.

🌈My future interests also include automatic few-shots learning for anomaly (pest & disease stress) region detection at crop field using UAV hyper/multi-spectral imaging, points cloud☁️ segmentation & 3D traits measurment📏 using UAV LiDAR.
