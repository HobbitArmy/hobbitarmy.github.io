I am currently a doctoral student at Zhejiang University, majoring in Agricultural Electrification and Automation 👨🏼‍🌾, advised by Prof. Fei Liu. My study is focused on field crop traits extracting and mapping using UAV imagery and deep-learning models 🤖. 

I have been working on rice field segmentation and phenology detection using direct geo-located UAV imagery during 2022. Recently I also began researching super resolution to bridging UAV 🛸 and satellite 🛰️ data. 
Besides I plan to segment crop LiDAR points cloud to measure📏 their 3D traits automatically, 
and detect pest & disease stress🤯 of crops using multispectral imaging.
